<h1 align="center"> The Life in Wales Quiz</h1>

This quiz was derived from our 'alternative route to UK citizenship' quiz - Life in the UK - which was written by Oli Frost while his dad, Roger F made the app in lovable.dev. See Oli's work: [olifro.st](https://olifro.st). See the UK quiz https://oli-frost-uk-life-quiz.lovable.app
